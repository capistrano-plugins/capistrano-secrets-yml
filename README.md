# Capistrano::SecretsYml

Capistrano tasks for handling `secrets.yml` when deploying Rails 4+ apps.

### Install

Add this to `Gemfile`:

    group :development do
      gem 'capistrano', '~> 3.2.1'
      gem 'capistrano-secrets-yml', '~> 1.0.0'
    end

And then:

    $ bundle install

### Setup and usage

- make sure your local `config/secrets.yml` is not git tracked. It **should be on
  the disk**, but gitignored.

- populate production secrets in local `config/secrets.yml`:

        production:
          secret_key_base: d6ced...

- add to `Capfile`:

        require 'capistrano/secrets_yml'

- create `secrets.yml` file on the remote server by executing this task:

        $ bundle exec cap production setup

You can now proceed with other deployment tasks.

#### What if a new config is added to secrets file?

- add it in local `config/secrets.yml`:

        production:
          secret_key_base: d6ced...
          foobar: some_other_secret

- and copy to the server:

        $ bundle exec cap production setup

- do not forget to notify your colleagues who also have deploy rights that the file has been changed so they update their copy, and do not forget to compare your own copy to the one you are going to overwrite just in case you missed an update.

### How it works

When you execute `$ bundle exec production setup`:

- secrets from your local `secrets.yml` are copied to the server.<br/>
- only "stage" secrets are copied: if you are deploying to `production`,
  only production secrets are copied there
- on the server secrets file is located  in `#{shared_path}/config/secrets.yml`

On deployment:

- secrets file is automatically symlinked to `#{current_path}/config/secrets.yml`

### Configuration

None.

### FAQ

- shouldn't we be keeping configuration in environment variables as per
  [12 factor app rules](http://12factor.net/config)?

  On Heroku, yes.<br/>
  With Capistrano, those env vars still have to be written somewhere on the disk
  and used with a tool like [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv).

  Since we have to keep configuration on the disk anyway, it probably makes
  sense to use Rails 4 built-in `secrets.yml` mechanism.
